<h2> Controllers of Personal Information</h2>

    <p>Any personal information provided to or gathered by Sticky Seller Services Private Limited under this Privacy Notice will be stored and controlled by Sticky Media EU SARL (the data controller), at 5 Rue Plaetis, L-2338, Luxembourg.</p>
 
<h2> What Personal Information About Customers Does Sticky.com Gather?</h2> 

    <p> The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience at Sticky.com. We use your information to assist sellers in handling orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.</p>
 
<p> Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
 
<p> 
<strong> Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving our platform, and communicating with you.</p>

<p> 
<strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Sticky.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Sticky.com on other Web sites. We may also receive/store information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information for internal analysis and to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content.</p>
 
<p> 
<strong> E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Sticky.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.</p>
 
<p> 
<strong> Information from Other Sources:</strong> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</p>
 
<p> By using or continuing to use the site you agree to our use of your information (including sensitive personal information) in accordance with this Privacy Notice, as may be amended from time to time by Sticky.com in its discretion. You also agree and consent to us collecting, storing, processing, transferring and sharing information (including sensitive personal information) related to you with third parties or service providers for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Notice.</p>
 
<p> We may be required to share the aforesaid information with government authorities and agencies for the purposes of verification of identity or for prevention, detection or investigation, including of cyber incidents, prosecution and punishment of offences. You agree and consent for Sticky.com to disclose your information, if so required, under applicable law.</p>
 
<h2> What About Cookies?</h2> 
		
<ul>
<li>
<span>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and to provide features such as Recommended for You, personalised advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., Sticky Associates with content served by Sticky.com) and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.</span>
</li>

<li>
<span>The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Sticky.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Sticky.com products and services that require you to Sign in.</span>
</li>

<li>
<span>If you do leave cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.</span>

<h2> Does Sticky.com share the Information it receives?</h2>

    <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Sticky.com shares customer information only as described below and with Sticky.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries which Sticky.com, Inc., controls and that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
 
		
<ul>
<li>
<span><strong> Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Sticky.com or sell offerings to you at Sticky.com. In other cases, we provide services jointly with or on behalf of these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party.</span>
</li>

<li>
<span> <strong> Third Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable law.</span>
</li>
 
<li>
<span> <strong> Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Sticky.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.</span>
</li>
 
<li>
<span> <strong> Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Sticky.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</span>
</li>
 
<li>
<span> <strong> Protection of Sticky.com and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with applicable law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Sticky.com, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies, organisations, government or regulatory authorities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice</span>
</li>
 
<li>
<span> <strong> With your consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</span>
</li>	
</ul>
 
<h2> How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2> 
		
<ul>
<li>
<span>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input in addition to maintaining security of your information as per the International Standard IS/ISO/IEC 27001 on "Information Technology Security Techniques Information Security Management System-Requirements".</span>
</li>

<li>
<span> We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</span>
</li>
 
<li>
<span>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal information (including sensitive personal information). Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</span>
</li>

<li>
<span>It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off.</span>
